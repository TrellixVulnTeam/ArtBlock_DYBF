There's other ways to run the server but here's how I do it:
1. Navigate to ArtBlock\server in Windows Explorer
2. Run powershell by typing "powershell" into the file path
3. Type "python manage.py runserver". Server should be running at 127.0.0.1:8000/.

or just skip the second step and type the third command directly into the file path

From here, it's set up so you can access the API in three different ways (as defined in server\server\urls.py). This is done by using different url paths in your browser.

To search by name of color, navigate to 127.0.0.1:8000/Color:Colorname, such as 127.0.0.1:8000/Color:Red. This is case-sensitive. The API I'm using supports these color names: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Violet, Brown, Grey, Black, White.

To search by hexcode, navigate to 127.0.0.1:8000/Color:hexcode, such as 127.0.0.1:8000/Color:fcba03. Hexcode should be 6 characters with lowercase letters. Internally, the hexcode is rounded to the nearest color.

To search by keyword, navigate to 127.0.0.1:8000/keyword, such as 127.0.0.1:8000/tree. Capitalization shouldn't matter here.

By default, the webpage returns 3 images, but you can change the "limit" variable in server\quickstart\services.py if you want.

Note: Unfortunately, this is very slow right now, so when you filter by color it'll take a long time to load. You can still see the progress in the terminal - when you see the word "loop," that means one image has been found already. Filter by keyword should be fairly fast though because the API does support searching by title.
